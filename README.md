## Instructions

One of the jobs of a software engineer is turning vague half-formed ideas into working software.
Given an assignment in the form of a user experience, use the **imagine how to use it** strategy to **decide what software to write**.

1. Look at the assignment (the user experience example)
2. Start by typing out an imagined interaction.
3. Apply the **imagine how to use it** strategy.
4. Convert the examples into tests. 
5. Set up RSpec
6. Get the first failing test
7. Perform **race to green** strategy! See if you can make your test pass *purely* by fixing what the error messages tell you is wrong.
